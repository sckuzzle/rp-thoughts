In figuring out the new RocketPool tokenomics proposals, analyses were performed to ensure the system was secure or optimal to encourage desired behaviours.  This directory contains:

* [LEB4 Profitability](./LEB4.md), in which the relative profitability (and thus incentive to reduce) of LEB4 is as compared to LEB8
* [MEV Theft](./MEV.md), in which the amount of money an opportunistic thief stands to make at various node sizes with sublinear bonding

Analyses performed by sckuzzle with feedback and guidance from Valdorff, Epineph, and Samus.
